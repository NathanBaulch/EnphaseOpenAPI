     * energy_lifetime
     * Returns a daily time series of energy produced by the system over its lifetime. All measurements are in Watt hours. The time series includes one entry for each day from the start_date to the end_date with no gaps in the time series. If the response includes trailing zeroes, such as [909, 4970, 0, 0, 0], then no energy has been reported for the last days in the series. If the system has a meter, the time series includes data as measured by the microinverters until the first full day after the meter has been installed. Later, it switches to using the data as measured by the meter. This is called the \"merged time series\". The attribute 'meter_start_date' indicates the time when the meter measurements begin to be used. You can retrieve the complete time series from the meter and from the microinverters by adding the parameter production=all to the request.
