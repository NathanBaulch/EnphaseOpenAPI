      summary: List of Activations
      description: Returns a list of activations for which the user can make API requests. There is a limit to the number of activations which can be returned at one time.
        If the first request does not return a full list, use the 'next' attribute in the response body to request the next page. By default, activations are returned in batches of 100.
        The maximum page size is 1000. Provide only valid filters. During filter the activations empty and invalid filter fields are ignored.
        In case the installer ID doesn't exist, API will return an empty array.
